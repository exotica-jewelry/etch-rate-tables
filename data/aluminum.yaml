# VISIBILITY
# Throughout this file, you'll see options for "visible". Setting these to false
# will hide the item from sighted users, while leaving the item in the HTML
# structure to make it available to screen readers. Commenting out a section
# will remove it from the HTML completely.

# TITLE - required
# Used as the <caption> element. Even if you choose to hide this in your
# display, it's important for it to exist in the HTML for assistive devices.
title:
  text: Etch rate for aluminum (3003) with Multi-Etch
  visible: true

# SUMMARY - optional
# This is a summary of the data for assistive devices, as an alternative to
# reading through all of the data. This is NOT a subtitle or introductory note
# -- for any of those things, use "note", below. This is used as the `summary`
# attribute of the HTML table. While this attribute is depreciated in HTML5,
# many screen readers continue to use it.

  text:
  visible: false

# NOTE - optional
# This is a nonstandard table element, but used to display information at the
# top of the table, below the title but above the headings.
note:

# FOOTER - optional
# Used in the <tfoot> element at the bottom of the table. Useful for footnotes
# or other non-critical notes to the table as a whole.
footer:

# TODO: Allow defining particular columns as text or numbers.

# ROWS - required
# Each row of data follows the headings defined above, in order.
